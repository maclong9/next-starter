## Theming

Theming is done with `theme-colors` for generating tailwind shades, you can change the colors by editing the `tailwind.config.ts` file. You also need to change the colors in the `src/styles/globals.css` file for styling shadcn components.

You can apply a font in the root layout file, using the `next/font` library to load the font.

## Adding Modules

You can add either `Stripe` if a payment system is required or `Resend` for email sending. To add a module, run `bunx kirimase@latest add`.

## Testing

You should write unit tests for functions not generated by the `kirimase` CLI and also for components not maintained by shadcn or acternity-ui. You can write tests in the same folder as the file you are testing.

End-to-end for application critical workflows should be written using `playwright`. Again no need to test generated components, actions or pages.
