- [ ] Add Responsive Modal

## Introduction
This is a Next.js application built with Kirimase, utilizing various modern web development tools and practices. It includes authentication, database integration, theming capabilities, and a modular structure for easy maintenance and scalability.

## Project Setup
To set up the project:
1. Clone the repository
2. Install dependencies:
   ```
   bun install
   ```
3. Set up environment variables (copy `.env.example` to `.env.local` and fill in the values)
4. Run the development server:
   ```
   bun dev
   ```

## Theming
Theming is implemented using `theme-colors` for generating Tailwind CSS shades. To modify the theme:
1. Edit the `tailwind.config.ts` file to change color definitions.
2. Update the colors in `src/app/globals.css` for styling shadcn components.

To apply a custom font:
1. Use the `next/font` library in the root layout file (`src/app/layout.tsx`).
2. Import and apply the font as shown in the existing layout file.

## Adding Modules
To add additional functionality:
1. Use Kirimase to add modules like Stripe (for payments) or Resend (for email):
   ```
   bunx kirimase@latest add
   ```
2. Follow the prompts to select and configure the desired module.

## Generating Application MVCs
Kirimase provides a powerful tool for generating new application MVCs (Model-View-Controller structures). To generate a new MVC:

1. Run the following command:
   ```
   bun run generate:mvc
   ```

2. Follow the interactive prompts to specify:
   - The name of your new resource (e.g., "Product", "User", "Order")
   - The fields for your resource and their types
   - Whether you want to generate CRUD operations
   - If you want to add the resource to the navigation

3. Kirimase will automatically:
   - Create a new database table schema
   - Generate API routes for CRUD operations
   - Create a new page for listing the resources
   - Add a form for creating and editing the resource
   - Update the navigation (if selected)

4. After generation, review the created files in:
   - `src/lib/db/schema`: For the new database schema
   - `src/lib/api`: For the generated API routes
   - `src/app/(app)`: For the new pages and forms

5. Customize the generated code as needed for your specific application requirements.

6. Run database migrations to apply the new schema:
   ```
   bun db:generate
   bun db:migrate
   ```

This feature allows you to quickly scaffold new parts of your application, saving time and ensuring consistency in your project structure.

## Testing

### Unit Testing
- Write unit tests for custom functions and components not generated by Kirimase CLI or maintained by shadcn/acternity-ui.
- Place test files in the same folder as the file being tested.
- Use Vitest for running unit tests:
  ```
  bun test:unit
  ```

### End-to-End Testing
- Use Playwright for end-to-end testing of critical application workflows.
- Avoid testing generated components, actions, or pages.
- Run e2e tests with:
  ```
  bun test:e2e
  ```

> [!NOTE]
> There are some example tests within the `tests/{unit,e2e}` folders which show an example of basic unit and end-to-end tests. There is also an example of a component/page test within `src/app/tests` to show how to test individualcomponent or page. Make sure to remove or edit these files before pushing the code so that you don't break the continuous integration.

## Authentication
Authentication is implemented using Lucia:
1. Sign-up and sign-in functionality is available in `src/app/(auth)/sign-up/page.tsx` and `src/app/(auth)/sign-in/page.tsx`.
2. Authentication logic is handled in `src/lib/auth/lucia.ts` and `src/lib/auth/utils.ts`.
3. Protected routes should use the `checkAuth` function from `src/lib/auth/utils.ts`.

## Database
The project uses Drizzle ORM with PostgreSQL:
1. Database schema is defined in `src/lib/db/schema/auth.ts`.
2. Run migrations with:
   ```
   bun db:migrate
   ```
3. Generate new migrations after schema changes:
   ```
   bun db:generate
   ```

## Folder Structure
- `src/app`: Next.js app router pages and layouts
- `src/components`: Reusable React components
- `src/lib`: Utility functions, database setup, and authentication
- `src/config`: Configuration files (e.g., navigation)
- `public`: Static assets

## Deployment
1. Ensure all environment variables are set in your deployment platform.
2. Run database migrations before deploying new versions.
3. Use the production build command:
   ```
   bun build
   ```
4. Deploy the application to your chosen platform (e.g., Vercel, Netlify).

Remember to keep your dependencies updated and regularly check for security vulnerabilities. Happy coding!
